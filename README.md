# Hello!  

I'm Lauri, happy to meet you!  

Feel free to peek around my repositories! Since you'll mostly find just stuff related to my university studies, let me guide you to some more interesting repos. 

## Specially curated selection for you 🤲

### [Amandus](https://github.com/Ohtu-project-Eficode/Amandus) - In-browser text editor aimed for [Robot framework](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework) files.  
  - Developed in a team with wonderful student colleagues as an assignment for software production course at Helsinki Uni.
  - Product owner and customer for this project was DevOps company [Eficode](https://www.eficode.com).
  - Personal highlights: I created an authorization flow to [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) and capsulated token management as a separate microservice server.
### [Arpanoid](https://github.com/lauripalonen/arpanoid) - Dice throwing bot for discord
  - I wanted to learn how to make a [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot, so this was that study case 
  - Aimed for tabletop rpg sessions during a pandemic lockdown; should some of the remote adventurers not have a dice set of their own, they can utilise the dice throwing bot Arpanoid. 
### [Quiz log](https://github.com/lauripalonen/tietovisatietokanta) - Log for pub quiz questions
  - Yet another Uni project, but made to serve a personal purpose; log the questions of a weekly pub quiz that I attend with my friends. From the data we can learn for example the most difficult quiz category for our team. 

## About me 👀
You may be able to decipher partly what kind of fellow I am by browsing through my repos, but let me save that trouble for you!  
- 👨‍🎓 I'm CS major at University of Helsinki. I'll be writing my bachelor's thesis on spring 2022 after which I'm looking for a place to develop my programming skills further (feel free to contact me about open positions 😉)
- 🎮 I enjoy gaming; be it [Heroes of Newerth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_of_Newerth), [Mahjong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Mahjong) or [D&D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) (to name a few).
- 🎸For soul cleansing I jam with my friends. I'm most familiar with guitar and bass, and trying to get better with piano (currently practising Ryuichi Sakamoto's [Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence](https://youtu.be/LGs_vGt0MY8)). A dream would be to learn a wind instrument one day.
- 🏋️‍♀️ For sports I go to gym and play badminton.
