#### Descriptions
[Amandus](https://github.com/Ohtu-project-Eficode/Amandus) is an interesting project from various points of view! Despite being another uni project, it was develop for a real life customer; [Eficode](https://www.eficode.com). It was a semester long group project, where we practised the scrum methodology with rotating roles, while gaining coding experience as well. Group was nothing short of what I wished for; motivated and eager individuals with a common goal. This was also basically my first touch on "legacy" code. Our group was the second iteration on this project and we started from where the previous group left. 
Starting with something I'm most eager to present, [Amandus](https://github.com/Ohtu-project-Eficode/Amandus)! This is university related as well, but still probably the coolest thing I've contributed to! It's an in-browser text editor aimed especially for [Robot framework](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework) files. This was done for a software production course as a group project, where our group had the pleasure of having [Eficode] as our customer.
